# Test Data

## Storage

### Sharepoint Site

[CORE Rules](https://cdisc.sharepoint.com/sites/CORERules/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx)

### Local OneDrive Access

It is recommended that you use OneDrive for the CORE Rules test data. This will allow you the ability to:

- edit test files on your local desktop without the need to upload or edit within the browser
- load test files in the CORE Editor by browsing to the Excel files without the need to download files from Sharepoint

There are two options for accessing the Sharepoint files from OneDrive. The choice is personal preference, but Sharepoint allows you to only do one or the other.

- [Sync Sharepoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-sharepoint-files-and-folders-87a96948-4dd7-43e4-aca1-53f3e18bea9b)
