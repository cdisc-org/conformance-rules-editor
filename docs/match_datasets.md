# Match Datasets (Merge)

## Non pivoted relationship - unique check variable names

> Matching on MH.USUBJID = DM.USUBJID: MH.MHENDTC >= DM.RFSTDTC

```yaml
Rule Type: Date Arithmetic
Check:
  all:
    - name: MHENDTC
      operator: date_greater_than_or_equal_to
      value: RFSTDTC
Match Datasets:
  - Name: DM
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
```

## Non pivoted relationship - shared check variable names

> Matching on --.VISITNUM = TV.VISITNUM: --.VISITDY != TV.VISITDY

```yaml
Check:
  all:
    - name: VISITDY
      operator: not_equal_to
      value: TV.VISITDY
Match Datasets:
  - Name: TV
    Keys:
      - VISITNUM
```

## Non pivoted relationship - non-matching key variable names

Allows for joining datasets with parent datasets using non-matching key variable names. The `Left` key is the name of the variable in the parent dataset and the `Right` key is the name of the variable in the dataset whose name is specified in `Name`.

> Condition: If specimen type is specified in RELSPEC and BS, the values should be the same in both datasets.

> Rule: Matching on RELSPEC.USUBJID = BS.USUBJID and RELSPEC.REFID = BS.BSREFID: RELSPEC.SPEC != BS.BSSPEC

```yaml
Check:
  all:
    - name: SPEC
      operator: not_equal_to
      value: BSSPEC
Match Datasets:
  - Name: BS
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
      - Left: REFID
        Right: BSREFID
Scope:
  Domains:
    Include:
      - RELSPEC
```

## Non pivoted relationship - left join

Allows for joining datasets with parent datasets, keeping all records from the parent dataset and only records with matching key values from the dataset whose name is specified in `Name`. `Join Type` may be `inner` or `left`. If `Join Type` is not specified, an inner join is performed (i.e., only records with matching key values in both datasets are kept).

> Condition: Extracted or aliquoted specimens should have a parent specimen identified in the RELSPEC dataset.

> Rule: Matching on BE.USUBJID = RELSPEC.USUBJID and BE.BEREFID = RELSPEC.REFID: BEDECOD in ("EXTRACTING", "ALIQUOTING") AND RELSPEC.PARENT is empty

Reports extracting/aliquoting records from BE where:

- There is a matching record in RELSPEC, but PARENT is empty
- There is no matching record in RELSPEC.

```yaml
Check:
  all:
    - any:
        - name: BEDECOD
          operator: equal_to
          value: EXTRACTING
        - name: BEDECOD
          operator: equal_to
          value: ALIQUOTING
    - name: PARENT
      operator: empty
Match Datasets:
  - Name: RELSPEC
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
      - Left: BEREFID
        Right: REFID
    Join Type: left
Scope:
  Domains:
    Include:
      - BE
```

## Child to Parent Merge (Child: true)

By default, dataset merging follows a **parent → child** direction, where the parent dataset (specified in Scope) is merged with the child datasets (specified in Match Datasets). The `Child: true` property reverses this direction to perform a **child → parent** merge.

When `Child: true` is specified:
- The dataset specified in `Name` becomes the primary dataset (child)  
- The parent dataset (based on RDOMAIN) becomes the secondary dataset being merged in
- All records from the child dataset are preserved
- Only matching records from the parent dataset are included

> Rule: Matching on AE.USUBJID = DM.USUBJID, Check DM records with their corresponding AE values based on USUBJID.  Also checks RELREC which is matched on DOMAIN and USUBJID.  Note: the child is the left dataset in the merge so RDOMAIN must be left

```yaml
Match Datasets:
  - Name: DM
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
    Child: true
  - Name: RELREC
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
      - Left: RDOMAIN
        Right: DOMAIN
    Child: true
Scope:
  Domains:
    Include:
      - DM
      - RELREC
```

## Pivoted (Supp/VL) relationship
When 'Is Relationship: True' is specified, the system filters a parent dataset using a supplementary dataset that defines allowed column-value pairs. The supplementary dataset must contain two columns - one specifying which columns to filter in the parent dataset (IDVAR) and another containing the allowed values (IDVARVAL) - enabling complex filtering.

> If your Supp-- dataset looks like below and 'Is Relationship: True', it will 'keep rows where ECSEQ is 100 or 101 AND ECNUM is 105'
```
IDVAR    IDVARVAL
ECSEQ    100
ECSEQ    101
ECNUM    105
```

> Record present in SUPPAE where SUPPAE.QNAM=AESOSP and AESMIE != 'Y'

```yaml
Check:
  all:
    - name: QNAM
      operator: equal_to
      value: AESOSP
    - any:
        - name: AESMIE
          operator: not_exists
        - name: AESMIE
          operator: not_equal_to
          value: Y
Match Datasets:
  - Name: SUPPAE
    Keys:
      - USUBJID
    Is Relationship: true
```

## RELREC Relationship

Allows for joining datasets with parent datasets using conditions specified in RELREC dataset

> Condition: Related record present in parent domain dataset

> Rule: FAOBJ in (--TERM, --TRT, --DECOD)

```yaml
Check:
  all:
    - name: FAOBJ
      operator: not_equal_to
      value: RELREC.__TERM
    - name: FAOBJ
      operator: not_equal_to
      value: RELREC.__TRT
    - name: FAOBJ
      operator: not_equal_to
      value: RELREC.__DECOD
Match Datasets:
  - Name: RELREC
    Wildcard: __
Outcome:
  Message:
    Related record is present in the parent domain dataset and FAOBJ is not
    in (--TERM, --TRT, --DECOD)
  Output Variables:
    - FAOBJ
    - RELREC.__TERM
    - RELREC.__TRT
    - RELREC.__DECOD
Rule Type: Record Data
Scope:
  Classes:
    Include:
      - FINDINGS
  Domains:
    Include:
      - FA
```

## Wildcard Property

The Wildcard property creates a dynamic pattern that substitutes for domain prefixes in SDTM variable names. This allows you to write rules that work across multiple domains without having to specify each domain-specific variable separately.

- The default wildcard is `**` if not specified
- Using `--` (two hyphens) is not recommended as the engine has built-in logic to replace the "--" pattern with the current domain name. This happens early in the processing pipeline.
- Choose the wildcard pattern that makes your rules most readable (`__` or `**` are both common choices)
- reference variables in your check will match your wildcard i.e. RELREC.__TERM
